His tools are blunt — email blitzes to RCMP leadership and politicians, legal pushes to de-platform doxxing sites, viral video confrontations, and op-eds in the National Post.",
        "He founded Known to the Police to track repeat antisemitic offenders that the justice system releases. He's appeared on CPAC, debated critics on live radio, and organized rallies that fill city squares. Unapologetically Jewish is the digital centre of gravity for all of it.",
